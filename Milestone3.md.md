We replaced one of the minimal goals, "Tap the book to view what he or she has inputted and press (~1 sec) to edit it," with "Connect to Facebook group," "Elapsed time," and "Adding icon for the app." 

We realized these changes would better align with our app's functionality and utility, and they are also more challenging to implement.

We already accomplished our goal and finished the project. This submission is mainly to inform you about our change in the minimal goal for our group project.
